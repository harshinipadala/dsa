Data Types & Operators


int Data Type
int a = 5;
a is a variable in memory of int type and has value of 5 in.
An int variable generally takes 4 bytes in memory.
sizeof(a) will give the size (# of bytes) of the integer.

char Data Type
char ch = 'a';
char is the type to represent characters.
Characters always use '' and they generally take 1 byte in memory.

bool Data Type
bool b = true;
Bools have values of either true or false.
They take 1 byte in memory.
And true can also be represented by 1, and false by 0.

float Data Type
float f = 1.2;
Floats are used when floating point numbers are in use.
They take generally 4 bytes in memory.
Usually provide about 7 decimal digits of precision.

double Data Type
double d = 1.23;
Doubles take generally 8 bytes in memory.
Usually provide about 15 decimal digits of precision.

Type Casting
int a = 'a';
char ch = 98;
cout << a << ch << endl; 
This will output 97 and b.

Operators
int a = 2/5;
The answer to 2/5 will return 0 because the data type of the answer is int as well.
When using the divide operator, be wary of the data type of the answer.

Relational Operators: =, <, >, <=, >=, !=
Logical Operators (check multiple conditions): &&, ||, !
